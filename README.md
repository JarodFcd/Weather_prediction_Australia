# Weather prediction Australia


This is a data science project of classification in order to predict whether it rains or not next day in several Australian cities. The dataset used in this project is the ***Rain in Australia*** dataset on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ "Kaggle"), you can find it [here](https://www.kaggle.com/jsphyg/weather-dataset-rattle-package "Rain in Australia dataset on Kaggle").

This dataset contains about 10 years of daily weather observations from many locations across Australia. The aim is to predict next day rain by training classification models on the target variable `RainTomorrow`. It means : did it rain the next day, `Yes` or `No` ? The rest of the dataset is a mixture of categorical and numerical values.

A detailed explanation of the rest of the variables is provided in the available [pdf](../main/Weather_prediction_Australia.pdf). The objective is to compare a few machine learning methods. Please note that this project was only created to help me try and improve my data science skills.
